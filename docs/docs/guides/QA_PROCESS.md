## Introduction

This document outlines the Quality Assurance process for the Vibewell application, with a focus on the AR try-on feature, analytics tracking, and admin dashboard. It defines the testing procedures, quality standards, and review processes that must be completed before deployment to production.

## Testing Analytics Tracking

### Manual Testing

1. **Try-On Session Tracking:**
   - Navigate to the virtual try-on feature
   - Load different product models (makeup, hairstyle, accessories)
   - Verify session start/end metrics are captured correctly
   - Check that duration, intensity, and success/failure are properly recorded
   - Confirm user ID association with sessions

2. **Share Analytics Testing:**
   - Test all sharing methods (email, social platforms, download)
   - Verify share events are tracked with correct metadata
   - Validate error tracking for failed share attempts
   - Confirm analytics data appears in admin dashboard

3. **Admin Dashboard Verification:**
   - Test data filtering by date ranges (day, week, month)
   - Verify metrics calculations (average duration, success rate)
   - Check visualization of data in charts
   - Validate user engagement metrics

### Automated Testing Requirements

1. Create test cases that simulate analytics events
2. Verify data storage in Supabase tables
3. Validate API responses and error handling
4. Test metrics calculation functions

### Verification Steps

1. Run the `/test` page to generate sample analytics data
2. Use SQL queries to verify data integrity in Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM try_on_sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   SELECT * FROM share_analytics ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. Verify metrics displayed in admin dashboard match raw data

## Validating AR Model Loading and Caching

### Model Loading Tests

1. **Initial Load Testing:**
   - Test loading each AR model type
   - Verify progress indicators work correctly

2. **Cache Testing:**
   - Verify models are properly cached after initial load
   - Test subsequent loads to confirm cache retrieval
   - Validate cache size management
   - Test cache persistence across sessions

3. **Prefetching Validation:**
   - Verify prefetching works for next model in sequence
   - Measure performance improvement from prefetching
   - Test prefetching with limited bandwidth

### Technical Validation

1. **IndexedDB Storage:**
   - Verify models are stored correctly in IndexedDB
   - Check storage limits and cleanup mechanisms
