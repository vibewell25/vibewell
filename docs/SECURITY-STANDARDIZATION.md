# VibeWell Security Standardization

This document outlines the security standards, best practices, and implementations across the VibeWell application.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication System

The authentication system has been standardized with a unified approach that:

- Uses Supabase Auth for web authentication
- Provides cross-platform compatibility for mobile
- Implements proper role-based access control
- Centralizes auth logic in `src/contexts/unified-auth-context.tsx`
- Provides consistent helper utilities in `src/hooks/use-unified-auth.ts`

The auth context provides:
- Secure session management
- User role validation
- Protection against session hijacking
- Proper JWT validation and refresh mechanisms

### 2. CSRF Protection

Custom CSRF protection has replaced the vulnerable `csurf` package:

- Implements HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- Sets secure, HttpOnly cookies with proper SameSite attributes
- Validates tokens for non-safe HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Provides both server-side and client-side utilities
- Protects against timing attacks with constant-time comparisons
- Implements token expiration (24 hours)

Implementation: `src/middleware/security/csrf.ts`

### 3. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting protects against brute force attacks and DoS attempts:

- Limits requests based on IP address
- Configurable time windows and request limits
- Memory-efficient storage with automatic cleanup
- Sets proper Retry-After headers
- Configurable per-route limits for sensitive endpoints

Implementation: `src/middleware/security/index.ts`

### 4. Security Headers

Comprehensive security headers have been implemented:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- Referrer-Policy to control information leakage
- Permissions-Policy to limit feature access

Implementation: `src/middleware.ts`

### 5. Input Validation

All user input is validated:

- Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- Client-side validation for user experience
- Prevention of SQL injection through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper encoding and CSP
- API schema validation to enforce type safety

### 6. Data Encryption

Sensitive data is encrypted:

- Field-level encryption for PII in `fieldEncryption` utility
- Uses AES-256-CBC with random IVs
- Environment variable-based key management
- Encrypted password reset tokens

Implementation: `src/middleware/security/index.ts`

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables

- All sensitive credentials stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Local .env files excluded from version control
- Different environment variables for development, testing, and production

### 2. Error Handling

- Generic error messages to users to prevent information leakage
- Detailed internal logging for debugging
- Error categorization for proper handling
- Proper stack trace handling to prevent exposure

### 3. Dependencies

- Regular security audits with npm audit
- Safe package updates with testing
- Removal of unused vulnerable dependencies
- Explicit dependency versioning to prevent supply chain attacks

### 4. TypeScript Safety

- Strict type checking enabled
- No implicit any types
- Proper interface definitions for all data structures
- Reduced use of type assertions

## Security Testing

The following tests ensure security standards are maintained:

1. **CSRF Testing**
   - Validation of token generation
   - Expiration checks
   - Proper cookie attributes
   - Protection against forgery attempts

2. **Rate Limiting Tests**
   - Verification of request counting
   - Proper throttling when limits exceeded
   - Correct Retry-After headers

3. **Authentication Tests**
   - Session integrity verification
   - Role-based access control tests
   - Session timeout checks
   - Token refresh behavior

4. **Header Validation**
   - Verification of security headers presence
   - CSP validation
   - HSTS configuration checks

## Security Monitoring

The application includes:

- Client-side error tracking
- Authentication failure monitoring
- Rate limit breach detection
- Security header validation
- API access monitoring

## Recommended Security Improvements

Future security enhancements should include:

1. Implement WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless authentication
2. Add multi-factor authentication support
3. Enhance audit logging for security-relevant events
4. Implement security-focused automated testing in CI/CD
5. Regular penetration testing and security audits
