## Overview

The VibeWell audit system is a comprehensive monitoring and reporting framework that provides:

- Continuous monitoring across multiple aspects of the platform

- User experience evaluation and accessibility compliance

The system is built with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization.

## Audit Categories

The audit system covers the following categories:

### 1. Security Audits

- Vulnerability scanning (with CVSS scoring)
- PCI DSS compliance checking
- Data protection and privacy controls
- Social media security features
- Penetration testing integration

### 2. Performance Audits

- Load testing and stress testing
- Mobile app performance optimization
- Database performance monitoring
- Frontend performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)
- API response time analysis

### 3. UX Audits

- User flow testing with completion rates
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Booking UX evaluation
- Responsiveness across devices
- User satisfaction metrics

### 4. Compliance Audits

- GDPR compliance verification
- CCPA compliance verification
- Data retention policy enforcement
- User consent management
- Financial transaction validation

### 5. Booking System Audits

- Booking integrity and double booking prevention
- Notification delivery verification
- Booking performance metrics
- Availability synchronization

## Audit Services

The audit system is composed of the following services:

1. **AuditService**: Core service for reporting and tracking issues
2. **SecurityAuditService**: Specialized for security-related audits
3. **PerformanceAuditService**: Specialized for performance monitoring
4. **UXAuditService**: Specialized for user experience testing
5. **ComplianceAuditService**: Specialized for regulatory compliance
6. **BookingAuditService**: Specialized for booking system integrity
7. **AuditController**: Central controller that coordinates all audit activities

These services work together to provide a holistic view of the platform's health and compliance status.

## Usage

### Running Audits

You can run audits using the provided npm scripts:

```bash
# Generate an audit report with test data
npm run audit:generate-report

# Run category-specific audits
npm run audit:security
npm run audit:performance
npm run audit:ux
npm run audit:compliance
npm run audit:booking

# Run a comprehensive audit across all categories
npm run audit:comprehensive
```

### Integrating in Code

You can also integrate audits into your code:

```typescript
import { 
  auditService, 
  AuditCategory, 
  AuditSeverity 
} from './src/services/audit';

// Report an issue
await auditService.reportIssue(
  AuditCategory.SECURITY,
  AuditSeverity.HIGH,
  'SQL Injection Vulnerability',
  'Found potential SQL injection in user search endpoint',
  {
    component: 'API',
    remediation: 'Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation',
  }
);

// Generate a report
const securityReport = auditService.generateReport(AuditCategory.SECURITY);
```

### Running Specialized Audits

Each audit service provides specialized methods:

```typescript
import { securityAuditService } from './src/services/audit';

// Process vulnerability scan results
await securityAuditService.processVulnerabilityResults([
  {
    id: 'CVE-2023-1234',
    title: 'XSS Vulnerability',
    description: 'Cross-site scripting vulnerability in comments',
    cvssScore: 7.5,
    severity: 'high',
    component: 'Web UI',
  }
]);
```

## API Endpoints

The audit system exposes the following API endpoints:

### GET `/api/audit`

Returns all audit reports.

Query parameters:
- `reportId`: Get a specific report by ID
- `category`: Get all reports for a specific category
- `comprehensive`: If set to `true`, returns the latest comprehensive report

### POST `/api/audit`

Performs audit actions.

Request body:
```json
{
  "action": "run_comprehensive_audit" | "run_category_audit" | "report_issue" | "update_issue",
  "category": "security" | "performance" | "ux" | "compliance" | "booking",
  "data": { ... } // Additional data for report_issue and update_issue actions
}
```

## Audit Reports

Audit reports are generated in JSON format and stored in the `reports/audit` directory. The reports include:

- Summary metrics for all categories
- Detailed issue listings with severity
- Recommended remediation steps
- Timestamp information
- Component breakdown of issues

Example comprehensive report structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1685432167890,
  "summary": {
    "issuesByCategory": { ... },
    "issuesBySeverity": { ... },
    "totalIssues": 25
  },
  "security": { ... },
  "performance": { ... },
  "ux": { ... },
  "compliance": { ... },
  "booking": { ... }
}
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The audit system can be integrated with your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# In your GitHub Actions workflow
jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run comprehensive audit
        run: npm run audit:comprehensive
      - name: Upload audit results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: audit-results
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}/audit-reports/
```

## Custom Audit Implementation

You can extend the audit system by implementing custom audit services:

1. Create a new audit service class that follows the existing pattern
2. Register it with the main AuditController
3. Add custom reporting methods
4. Implement thresholds and notification triggers

Example custom audit service:

```typescript
import auditService, { AuditCategory, AuditSeverity } from '../audit-service';

class CustomAuditService {
  private results: Map<string, any> = new Map();

  public async recordCustomResult(result: any): Promise<void> {
    this.results.set(result.id, result);
    
    // Report issues if thresholds are exceeded
    if (someCondition) {
      await auditService.reportIssue(
        AuditCategory.SECURITY, // or another category
        AuditSeverity.HIGH,
        'Custom Issue Title',
        'Custom Issue Description',
        {
          component: 'Custom Component',
          metadata: { ... }
        }
      );
    }
  }
  
  // Additional methods...
}
```

## Next Steps

To continue improving the audit system:

1. Implement real integrations with actual vulnerability scanners
2. Set up scheduled audits using cron jobs
3. Create a dashboard UI for visualizing audit results
4. Implement automated remediation for common issues
5. Add trend analysis for tracking improvements over time
