# Testing Infrastructure Updates

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix testing issues and update dependencies in the VibeWell platform.

### 1. Fixed Missing Dependencies

- Ensured `@testing-library/jest-dom` was installed and properly configured
- Updated Jest setup files to properly extend with jest-dom matchers
- Separated setup files for browser and Node.js environments

### 2. Addressed Network Connection Issues in Tests

- Updated MSW (Mock Service Worker) to the latest version (v2.x)
- Migrated from outdated `rest` API to new `http`/`HttpResponse` API
- Created proper mock handlers for API endpoints
- Added better error handling in test cases

### 3. Fixed Mock Implementations

- Improved Three.js and AR component mocks
- Created a more robust Redis mock using `ioredis-mock`
- Simplified testing for components with complex dependencies

### 4. Created Specialized Test Configurations

- Created `jest.smoke.config.js` for Node.js tests (smoke, rate-limiting)
- Updated `jest.config.js` for component/unit tests
- Added proper transform patterns for TypeScript files
- Configured proper module name mapping

### 5. Added Convenience Scripts

- Added npm scripts for different test types:
  - `test:unit`: For component and unit tests
  - `test:smoke`: For smoke tests
  - `test:rate-limiting`: For rate limiting tests
  - `test:node`: For all Node.js environment tests
  - `test:all`: Comprehensive script to run all tests
- Created a shell script (`scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) for running all tests with detailed reporting

### 6. Updated Documentation

- Created comprehensive README in `/tests` directory
- Documented test structure and organization
- Added instructions for creating new tests
- Included troubleshooting tips

### 7. Security Improvements

- Added transformIgnorePatterns to properly handle dependencies
- Updated outdated/vulnerable dependencies where possible

## Known Issues

The following issues still need attention:

1. Vulnerabilities in dependencies:
   - `@walletconnect/web3-provider` and related dependencies
   - These could be addressed by removing the web3 dependencies if they're not essential

2. Type definitions:
   - Some type errors may still exist and could be fixed with more specific type definitions

## Next Steps

1. Consider removing non-essential dependencies that have vulnerabilities
2. Add more comprehensive security tests
3. Further improve test coverage
4. Consider migrating from Cypress to Playwright for E2E testing
5. Implement automated dependency scanning and updates
