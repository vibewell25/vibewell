# VibeWell Security Best Practices

This guide outlines security best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining the VibeWell platform. Following these guidelines will help protect user data and maintain the integrity of the platform.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- Use Auth0 for all user authentication flows
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts
- Set appropriate token expiration times (recommended: 1-2 hours)
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints

### Authorization
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) consistently
- Apply principle of least privilege for all user roles
- Validate permissions on both client and server side
- Never trust client-side authorization checks alone
- Regularly audit user roles and permissions

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Never store plaintext passwords or sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement data encryption at rest for sensitive information
- Use secure methods for data transmission (HTTPS, TLS)
- Mask or truncate sensitive data in logs

### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement database connection pooling with limits
- Keep database credentials secure and routinely rotated
- Back up databases regularly and test restoration procedures
- Limit database user permissions to only what's necessary

### File Storage Security
- Set proper access controls on AWS S3 buckets
- Implement signed URLs with short expiration times for file access
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Validate file types, sizes, and content before storage
- Generate random, unpredictable filenames for stored content

## API Security

### Endpoint Protection
- Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Use proper HTTP methods for operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validate all input data on the server
- Implement comprehensive error handling that doesn't leak information

### Protection Against Common Attacks
- Implement CSRF protection for all forms
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Enable XSS protection headers
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use HSTS headers for HTTPS enforcement

## Code Security

### Secure Development Practices
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Conduct regular code reviews with security focus
- Use static analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies up to date with vulnerability scanning
- Implement security linting rules

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update all dependencies
- Use `npm audit` or equivalent to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions to prevent unexpected updates
- Remove unused dependencies
- Consider using a lockfile for consistent builds

## Infrastructure Security

### Server/Serverless Security
- Keep all server environments patched and updated
- Limit server access to necessary personnel only
- Use firewalls and security groups to control access
- Monitor server logs for suspicious activity
- Implement proper user access controls on servers

### Cloud Security
- Follow AWS security best practices
- Use IAM roles with least privilege principles
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Regularly review and audit cloud resources

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Implement logging for security-relevant events
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Monitor authentication failures
- Use tools like Sentry for error monitoring
- Regularly review security logs

### Incident Response
- Create an incident response plan
- Define roles and responsibilities during a security incident
- Document steps for containment, eradication, and recovery
- Establish communication procedures during incidents
- Conduct post-incident reviews

## Compliance

### Data Privacy
- Implement GDPR compliance measures
- Create clear privacy policies
- Provide data export and deletion capabilities for users
- Limit data collection to what's necessary
- Implement data retention policies

### Health Information
- Ensure HIPAA compliance for all health-related data
- Implement additional security for health information
- Create Business Associate Agreements when necessary
- Train developers on health data regulations
- Conduct regular HIPAA compliance assessments

## Deployment Security

### CI/CD Security
- Secure your CI/CD pipelines
- Scan code during the build process
- Use secrets management for deployment credentials
- Implement proper access controls for deployment systems
- Verify deployment integrity

### Production Safeguards
- Implement staging environments that mirror production
- Conduct security testing before production deployment
- Use blue/green deployment strategies
- Implement rollback capabilities
- Regularly test disaster recovery procedures

## Regular Security Practices

### Security Testing
- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Implement security unit tests
- Perform regular vulnerability scanning
- Use OWASP ZAP or similar tools for application security testing
- Test authentication and authorization controls regularly

### Security Training
- Provide security training for all developers
- Keep the team updated on security best practices
- Conduct secure code reviews
- Hold regular security workshops
- Create a security-conscious culture

## Third-Party Services

### Vendor Security
- Assess security practices of third-party services
- Limit third-party access to necessary data only
- Regularly review third-party access and permissions
- Monitor third-party service status and security updates
- Have contingency plans for third-party service outages

## Security Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date security documentation
- Document security configurations and controls
- Create security runbooks for common scenarios
- Keep a record of security decisions and changes
- Document security testing results and remediation
