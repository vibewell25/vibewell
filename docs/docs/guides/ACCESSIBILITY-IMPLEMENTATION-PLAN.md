# Accessibility Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines our approach to systematically improve the accessibility of the VibeWell platform, ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and providing an inclusive experience for all users.

## Current Status
- Basic keyboard navigation supported
- Some semantic HTML in place
- Limited ARIA implementation
- Inconsistent focus management
- Color contrast issues in some UI components
- Missing alt text for some images
- Limited screen reader testing

## Goals
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across the platform
- Implement accessible design patterns for all interactive components
- Ensure keyboard accessibility for all functionality
- Create a consistent focus management system
- Support major screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Establish accessibility testing as part of the development workflow

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Audit and Assessment (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Complete a thorough accessibility audit using automated and manual testing
- [ ] Document all accessibility issues by severity and affected components
- [ ] Create a prioritized remediation plan based on impact and usage
- [ ] Establish baseline accessibility metrics
- [ ] Set up automated accessibility testing tools

### Phase 2: Foundation and Infrastructure (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Create accessibility documentation and guidelines for developers
- [ ] Implement automated accessibility checks in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Establish accessibility testing protocols
- [ ] Create base accessible components for common UI patterns
- [ ] Define standards for keyboard interaction patterns

### Phase 3: Core Component Remediation (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Update core UI components for accessibility
  - [ ] Buttons, links, and interactive elements
  - [ ] Form controls (inputs, selects, checkboxes, radios)
  - [ ] Modals and dialogs
  - [ ] Navigation menus
  - [ ] Notification components
  - [ ] Tables and data display components
- [ ] Implement proper ARIA attributes and roles
- [ ] Ensure all components support keyboard navigation
- [ ] Fix focus management for interactive components
- [ ] Address color contrast issues

### Phase 4: Page-Level Improvements (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Implement consistent page structure with proper landmarks
- [ ] Add skip navigation links
- [ ] Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Optimize form pages for screen readers
- [ ] Improve error handling and announcements
- [ ] Implement accessible routing with focus management

### Phase 5: Content and Media (Weeks 13-14)
- [ ] Add alt text to all images
- [ ] Add captions/transcripts for video content
- [ ] Improve text alternatives for complex visualizations
- [ ] Ensure proper text spacing and readability
- [ ] Create accessible data visualizations and charts

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Weeks 15-16)
- [ ] Implement advanced ARIA patterns for complex widgets
- [ ] Create accessible drag and drop interfaces
- [ ] Implement accessible autocomplete components
- [ ] Optimize keyboard shortcuts and controls
- [ ] Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content

### Phase 7: Testing and Refinement (Weeks 17-18)
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive screen reader testing
- [ ] Perform keyboard-only testing
- [ ] Test with assistive technologies (screen magnifiers, voice control)
- [ ] Test on mobile screen readers
- [ ] Address findings and refine implementations

## Specific Component Improvements

### Navigation and Page Structure
- [ ] Add skip links to bypass repetitive navigation
- [ ] Implement proper landmark regions (header, main, nav, footer)
- [ ] Ensure logical tab order
- [ ] Add appropriate ARIA roles and properties

### Forms and Inputs
- [ ] Connect labels to inputs
- [ ] Add descriptive error messages
- [ ] Implement accessible validation
- [ ] Add input assistance where appropriate
- [ ] Group related form controls

### Interactive Elements
- [ ] Ensure proper focus indicators
- [ ] Implement accessible button and link patterns
- [ ] Add appropriate keyboard event handlers
- [ ] Ensure all actions can be performed via keyboard

### Modals and Overlays
- [ ] Trap focus within modal dialogs
- [ ] Add proper ARIA roles and attributes
- [ ] Return focus when dialogs close
- [ ] Implement accessible dismissal patterns

### Tables and Data
- [ ] Add proper table markup with headers
- [ ] Implement accessible sorting and filtering
- [ ] Add appropriate ARIA attributes for dynamic data
- [ ] Create responsive table patterns for small screens

## Tools and Resources

### Testing Tools
- Automated testing: Axe, Lighthouse, pa11y
- Screen readers: NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- Browser extensions: Axe DevTools, WAVE
- Manual testing checklist

### Development Resources
