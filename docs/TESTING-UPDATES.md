# Testing Infrastructure Updates

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix testing issues and update dependencies in the VibeWell platform.

### 1. Fixed Missing Dependencies

- Ensured `@testing-library/jest-dom` was installed and properly configured
- Updated Jest setup files to properly extend with jest-dom matchers
- Separated setup files for browser and Node.js environments

### 2. Addressed Network Connection Issues in Tests

- Updated MSW (Mock Service Worker) to the latest version (v2.x)
- Migrated from outdated `rest` API to new `http`/`HttpResponse` API
- Created proper mock handlers for API endpoints
- Added better error handling in test cases

### 3. Fixed Mock Implementations

- Improved Three.js and AR component mocks
- Created a more robust Redis mock using `ioredis-mock`
- Simplified testing for components with complex dependencies

### 4. Created Specialized Test Configurations

- Created `jest.smoke.config.js` for Node.js tests (smoke, rate-limiting)
- Updated `jest.config.js` for component/unit tests
- Added proper transform patterns for TypeScript files
- Configured proper module name mapping

### 5. Added Convenience Scripts

- Added npm scripts for different test types:
  - `test:unit`: For component and unit tests
  - `test:smoke`: For smoke tests
  - `test:rate-limiting`: For rate limiting tests
  - `test:node`: For all Node.js environment tests
  - `test:all`: Comprehensive script to run all tests
- Created a shell script (`scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) for running all tests with detailed reporting

### 6. Updated Documentation

- Created comprehensive README in `/tests` directory
- Documented test structure and organization
- Added instructions for creating new tests
- Included troubleshooting tips

### 7. Security Improvements

- Added transformIgnorePatterns to properly handle dependencies
- Updated outdated/vulnerable dependencies where possible

## Known Issues

The following issues still need attention:

1. Vulnerabilities in dependencies:
   - `@walletconnect/web3-provider` and related dependencies
   - These could be addressed by removing the web3 dependencies if they're not essential

2. Type definitions:
   - Some type errors may still exist and could be fixed with more specific type definitions

## Next Steps

1. Consider removing non-essential dependencies that have vulnerabilities
2. Add more comprehensive security tests
3. Further improve test coverage
4. Consider migrating from Cypress to Playwright for E2E testing
5. Implement automated dependency scanning and updates

# Testing Strategy for Vibewell Project

## Current Test Coverage Status

Current test coverage in the Vibewell project is approximately 4.24% (28 test files out of 661 source files). This indicates a significant opportunity for improvement.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Several tests fail due to missing dependencies.
2. **Configuration Issues**: Tests fail due to incorrect Jest configuration.
3. **Outdated Expectations**: Some tests have outdated selectors or expectations.
4. **Limited Component Coverage**: UI components lack adequate test coverage.
5. **No API Testing**: API endpoints and services lack proper tests.
6. **No Integration Tests**: There are limited tests for component interactions.
7. **No E2E Tests**: End-to-end testing is not implemented.

## Recent Improvements

We've implemented significant improvements to the testing infrastructure:

1. **Enhanced Testing Configuration**:
   - Created `jest.enhanced.config.js` with comprehensive Jest configuration
   - Added TypeScript declarations for testing libraries
   - Created mock implementations for Three.js and other external dependencies
   - Implemented test utilities for common testing tasks

2. **API Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Created a standardized API client for consistent API interactions
   - Implemented Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking
   - Added comprehensive tests for booking and profile services
   - Created test utilities for API testing

3. **Component Testing**:
   - Added tests for Button, Card, and Form components
   - Implemented accessibility testing with jest-axe
   - Created integration tests for form submission and validation

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the testing approach
   - Documented implementation plans and strategies
   - Added instructions for running tests with the new configuration

## Conclusion

The recent improvements to the testing infrastructure provide a solid foundation for building comprehensive test coverage. By following the outlined strategy and implementation plan, we can systematically increase test coverage and improve the reliability of the Vibewell application.

## Monitoring Test Coverage

We will use the following tools to monitor test coverage:

- Jest's built-in coverage reporter
- Our custom `check-test-coverage.js` script
- Regular code reviews with a focus on test coverage

Progress will be tracked in the project's sprint board and reviewed regularly with the development team.
