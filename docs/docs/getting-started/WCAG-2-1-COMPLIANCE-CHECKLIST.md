# WCAG 2.1 Compliance Checklist

A quick checklist to ensure your content meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Principle 1: Perceivable

1. Provide text alternatives for non-text content (images, icons).

3. Contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text and ≥ 3:1 for large text.
4. Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

## Principle 2: Operable

1. All functionality accessible via keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space).
2. Visible focus indicators for interactive elements.

2. Consistent navigation, headings, and labels across pages.
3. Provide input assistance: error messages, field labels, and instructions.

## Principle 4: Robust

1. Use valid, semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate.
2. Ensure compatibility with current and future user agents and assistive technologies.
3. Test with multiple browsers and screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA).
