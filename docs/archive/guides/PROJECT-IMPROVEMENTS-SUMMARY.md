# Project Improvements Summary for VibeWell

## Current Status

The VibeWell project has made significant progress but several inconsistencies and duplication issues need to be addressed before completion:

## Duplicate Files and Inconsistencies

### Authentication Hooks
- **Multiple auth hooks**: Found several implementations (`useAuth.ts`, `use-auth.ts`, `unified-auth.ts`, `use-unified-auth.ts`)
- **Inconsistent imports**: Different components import auth hooks from different locations (`@/lib/auth`, `@/contexts/auth-context`)
- **Action needed**: Standardize on `use-unified-auth.ts` as the single source of truth

### Form Validation
- **Multiple implementations**: Form validation logic exists in both utility files and individual components
- **Found in**: `src/utils/form-validation.ts` and several component files implementing their own validation
- **Action needed**: Standardize all form validation to use the centralized utility

### Documentation Inconsistencies
- Conflicting project status information across multiple files
- Outdated task lists that don't reflect current progress
- Duplicate implementation documents with potentially conflicting information

## Priority Tasks for Project Completion

1. **Code Consolidation**
   - Eliminate duplicate auth hook implementations
   - Standardize form validation across all components
   - Remove duplicate component implementations

2. **Documentation Cleanup**
   - Consolidate status documents into a single source of truth
   - Update task lists to reflect current progress
   - Remove or update outdated documentation

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Current test coverage is only 4.24%
   - Implement the test coverage plan with priority on core business logic
   - Fix existing test imports to use the correct hooks and utilities

4. **Service Implementation**
   - Implement email sending functionality in relevant services
   - Complete MFA middleware implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Sprint)**
   - Run duplicate file detection and consolidation
   - Update all imports to use standardized hooks and utilities

2. **Short-term (1-2 Weeks)**
   - Finish component standardization for high-priority components
   - Increase test coverage to at least 20% for critical paths
   - Complete documentation consolidation

3. **Medium-term (1 Month)**
   - Reach 40% test coverage
   - Complete accessibility implementation

This document supersedes previous project status documents and should be considered the authoritative source for project status as of the current date.

- `__mocks__/FBXLoader.js`
- `__mocks__/GLTFLoader.js`
- `__mocks__/KTX2Loader.js` (new)
- `__mocks__/EXRLoader.js` (new)
- `__mocks__/PMREMGenerator.js` (new)
- `__mocks__/HDRCubeTextureLoader.js` (new)

### React Three Fiber Mocks

- `__mocks__/@react-three/fiber.js`
- `__mocks__/@react-three/drei.js`

## 3. Sample Test Implementations

Created a sample component test to demonstrate the usage of the new testing utilities:

- `src/components/ui/Button.test.tsx`: Comprehensive test covering functionality, accessibility, and performance

## Conclusion

The implemented improvements provide a solid foundation for enhancing the quality, performance, and security of the VibeWell application. By systematically addressing testing, performance, and security concerns, we've established a framework that will support the long-term health and maintainability of the codebase.

The next phase of work should focus on implementing these tools and strategies within the application code, fixing existing test failures, and gradually increasing test coverage across the codebase.
