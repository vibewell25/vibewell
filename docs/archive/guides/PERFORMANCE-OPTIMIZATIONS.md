      setDevicePerformance(isLowEnd ? 'low' : 'high');
    };
    
    checkDevicePerformance();
  }, []);
  
  // Adaptive quality settings
  const dpr = (devicePerformance === 'low' || lowPerformanceMode) ? [0.5, 1] : [1, 2];
  const frameloop = (devicePerformance === 'low' || lowPerformanceMode) ? 'demand' : 'always';

  return (

  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const imageRef = useRef<HTMLImageElement>(null);
  
  // Determine proper priority based on position
  const effectivePriority = priority || aboveTheFold;
  const effectiveLoading = effectivePriority ? 'eager' : 'lazy';
  const effectiveFetchPriority = effectivePriority ? 'high' : 'auto';

  // Intersection Observer for images outside viewport
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!imageRef.current || effectivePriority) return;
    
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
      entries.forEach(entry => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {

      poolSize: poolOptions.poolSize || 5,
      retryDelay: poolOptions.retryDelay || 5000,
      maxRetries: poolOptions.maxRetries || 10,
    };
    
    // Initialize connection pool
    this.pool = this.createPool();
  }

  private getConnection(): Redis {
    const conn = this.pool[this.poolIndex];
    this.poolIndex = (this.poolIndex + 1) % this.pool.length;
    return conn;
  }

  public async get(key: string): Promise<string | null> {
    return this.executeCommand(async (client) => {
      const result = await client.get(key);
      return result;
    });
  }

  public async set(key: string, value: string, options?: { ex?: number }): Promise<'OK'> {

## Next Steps

We continue to optimize performance through:

1. Further code splitting and tree-shaking
2. Implementing HTTP/2 Server Push for critical resources
3. Adding predictive prefetching based on user behavior
4. Improving service worker caching strategies
5. Implementing better memory management for large datasets
