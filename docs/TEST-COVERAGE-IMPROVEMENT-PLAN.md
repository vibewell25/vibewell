# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- Current test coverage: ~20%
- Target coverage: 50%
- Priority areas: Core functionality, business logic, and critical user flows

## Strategy

Our approach to increasing test coverage will focus on:

1. **Prioritization**: Focus on high-value, high-risk areas first
2. **Consistency**: Establish and follow testing patterns
3. **Automation**: Integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline
4. **Monitoring**: Track coverage metrics over time

## Priority Areas

### 1. Core Business Logic (High Priority)
- User authentication and authorization
- Payment processing flows
- Booking and reservation systems
- Data mutation operations

### 2. UI Components (Medium Priority)
- Form components with validation
- Interactive components (modals, dropdowns, etc.)
- Layout components that control visibility
- Reusable UI components in the component library

### 3. API Routes (High Priority)
- Endpoint validation
- Error handling
- Authentication middleware
- Rate limiting

### 4. Utility Functions (Medium Priority)
- Date/time handling
- Formatting functions
- Calculation functions
- Data transformation helpers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Audit existing tests to identify gaps and redundancies
- [ ] Update test configuration for optimal coverage reporting
- [ ] Create testing templates and documentation for different test types
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting in CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Business Logic (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Add tests for authentication flows
- [ ] Add tests for payment processing
- [ ] Add tests for booking/reservation logic
- [ ] Add tests for user preference handling

### Phase 3: API Routes (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Test critical API endpoints
- [ ] Test error handling for API routes
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization middleware
- [ ] Test rate limiting and security features

### Phase 4: UI Components (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Test interactive components
- [ ] Test conditional rendering logic
- [ ] Test accessibility features

### Phase 5: Utilities and Edge Cases (Week 9-10)
- [ ] Test utility functions
- [ ] Add edge case tests for critical flows
- [ ] Test error boundaries and fallback UI
- [ ] Test performance-critical code paths

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Tests
- **Pattern**: Single function or component testing
- **Tools**: Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Coverage Goal**: 60% of all utility functions and individual components

### Integration Tests
- **Pattern**: Testing interaction between multiple units
- **Tools**: Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW
- **Coverage Goal**: 50% of all complex components and API interactions

### E2E Tests
- **Pattern**: Full user flow testing
- **Tools**: Playwright
- **Coverage Goal**: 90% of critical user journeys

## Tracking and Reporting

- Weekly coverage reports to be reviewed during sprint planning
- Coverage thresholds enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage dashboard to visualize progress over time
- Blocking PR merges that significantly decrease coverage

## Resources

- 2 dedicated QA engineers
- 1 sprint per month focused on testing improvements
- Developer education on writing testable code

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric**: Overall code coverage of 50%
- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - 80% coverage for critical business logic
  - 70% coverage for API routes
  - 50% coverage for UI components
  - 90% coverage for utility functions
  - Reduction in reported bugs by 30%

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation setup
- **Weeks 3-4**: Core business logic testing
- **Weeks 5-6**: API route testing  
- **Weeks 7-8**: UI component testing
- **Weeks 9-10**: Utilities and edge cases
- **Week 11-12**: Review, refinement, and documentation

## Maintenance Plan

After reaching the 50% coverage target:
- Add test coverage requirements to definition of done for new features
- Quarterly audit of test coverage
- Regular test maintenance to remove obsolete tests
- Continuous improvement toward long-term 80% coverage goal
