# Vibewell Test Infrastructure Fixes

## Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve failing tests and improve the testing infrastructure in the Vibewell project. These changes address TypeScript type errors, missing dependencies, and provide robust mocks for external libraries.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. TypeScript Declarations for Testing Libraries
- Created TypeScript declaration files for testing libraries to properly type test files:
  - `src/types/jest-dom.d.ts` - Adds proper typing for DOM testing matchers
  - `src/types/jest-axe.d.ts` - Adds typing for accessibility testing with jest-axe
  - `src/types/user-event.d.ts` - Provides types for user event simulations

### 2. Mock Files for External Dependencies
- Created comprehensive mock implementations for problematic dependencies:
  - `__mocks__/three.js` - Complete mock for Three.js library with all essential components
  - `__mocks__/GLTFLoader.js` - Mock for Three.js GLTF loader
  - `__mocks__/DRACOLoader.js` - Mock for Three.js DRACO loader
  - `__mocks__/fileMock.js` - Mock for file imports like images and fonts
  - `__mocks__/styleMock.js` - Mock for CSS and style imports

### 3. Enhanced Jest Setup
- Created `jest.enhanced-setup.js` that includes:
  - Integration with jest-dom and jest-axe
  - Custom matchers for improved test readability
  - Mock Service Worker (MSW) setup for API mocking
  - Browser API mocks (localStorage, sessionStorage, matchMedia)
  - Mocks for modern browser features (IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)
  - Enhanced user event simulation

### 4. Configuration Updates
- Created a script to update Jest configurations (`scripts/update-jest-configs.js`):
  - Updates all Jest config files to use the enhanced setup
  - Ensures proper module name mapping for external dependencies
  - Configures transform ignore patterns to handle node_modules correctly
  
### 5. Dependency Installation Script
- Enhanced `scripts/install-test-dependencies.sh` to:
  - Install required testing packages
  - Create all necessary type definitions
  - Set up mock files
  - Configure Jest properly
  - Update package.json scripts

## How to Use the New Testing Infrastructure

1. Run the dependency installation script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-test-dependencies.sh
   ```

2. Run tests with the enhanced configuration:
   ```bash
   npm run test:enhanced
   ```

3. Check test coverage:
   ```bash
   npm run test:enhanced:coverage
   ```

## Benefits of the New Testing Infrastructure

1. **TypeScript Support**: Proper type definitions eliminate TypeScript errors in test files.
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Built-in support for accessibility testing with jest-axe.
3. **Comprehensive Mocks**: Robust mocks for Three.js and other external dependencies enable testing of AR components.
4. **Enhanced Matchers**: Additional test matchers improve test readability and error messages.
5. **API Testing**: Integrated MSW for seamless API mocking.
6. **Browser API Simulation**: Mocks for browser APIs enable testing of components that use modern browser features.

## Next Steps

1. Update existing failing tests to use the new infrastructure
2. Add comprehensive tests for critical components
3. Implement continuous integration with the enhanced test configuration
4. Gradually increase test coverage as outlined in the testing strategy document
