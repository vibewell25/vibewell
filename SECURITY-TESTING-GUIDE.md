## Introduction
This guide outlines the security testing approach for the Vibewell application, an AR-enhanced wellness platform. It provides methodologies, tools, and best practices for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.

## Security Testing Scope
- **Authentication mechanisms** - Login, registration, password management
- **Authorization controls** - User permissions, access controls
- **Data handling** - Storage, transmission, validation
- **API endpoints** - RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- **Client-side code** - Front-end vulnerabilities
- **AR components** - WebGL, Three.js, and AR-specific security concerns
- **Third-party dependencies** - Libraries, frameworks, services

## Authentication & Authorization Testing

### Authentication Testing
- Test for weak password policies
- Verify account lockout mechanisms after failed attempts
- Test password reset functionality for security
- Verify multi-factor authentication if implemented
- Test session management (timeout, invalidation)

### Authorization Testing
- Verify role-based access controls
- Test for horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' data)
- Test for vertical privilege escalation (accessing admin features)
- Verify API endpoint permissions
- Test file access controls

## Data Validation Testing
- Test for SQL injection in database operations
- Test for NoSQL injection in document-based storage
- Verify input validation on all forms and API endpoints
- Test for XSS vulnerabilities in user input fields
- Test file upload validation and restrictions

## API Security Testing

### REST API Testing
- Verify proper authentication on all endpoints
- Test for proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Verify rate limiting implementation
- Test for sensitive data exposure in responses
- Verify CORS configuration

### GraphQL Testing
- Test for query depth and complexity limitations
- Verify proper authorization on resolvers
- Test for information disclosure in error messages
- Verify introspection and playground security in production

## Client-Side Security Testing
- Test for sensitive data in local/session storage
- Verify proper implementation of CSP
- Test for DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities
- Verify secure cookie attributes
- Test for client-side URL redirect vulnerabilities

## AR Component Security Testing
- Test for WebGL information leakage
- Verify secure loading of 3D assets
- Test for excessive resource consumption
- Verify camera permissions and usage
- Test for data leakage through AR features

## Dependency & Infrastructure Security
- Scan for vulnerable dependencies with tools like npm audit
- Verify secure deployment practices
- Test for security headers
- Test for secure TLS configuration
- Verify proper environment configuration

## Automated Security Testing Tools

### Static Analysis Tools
- ESLint with security plugins
- SonarQube for code quality and security
- Snyk for dependency scanning

### Dynamic Analysis Tools
- OWASP ZAP for automated scanning
- Burp Suite for API testing
- Artillery for load testing with security focus

### Integration in CI/CD
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for security testing
name: Security Testing
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run npm audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
      - name: Run ESLint security rules
        run: npx eslint --config .eslintrc.security.js
      - name: Run OWASP Dependency Check
        uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main
        with:
          project: 'Vibewell'
          path: '.'
          format: 'HTML'
          out: 'reports'
```

## Security Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All authentication flows tested
- [ ] Authorization controls verified
- [ ] Input validation tested on all forms and APIs
- [ ] API endpoints secured and tested
- [ ] Client-side security controls verified
- [ ] AR components tested for security
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security headers properly configured
- [ ] Error handling does not expose sensitive information
- [ ] Sensitive data properly encrypted

### Ongoing Security Testing
- [ ] Regular dependency scanning
- [ ] Periodic penetration testing
- [ ] Security regression testing after major updates
- [ ] User permission auditing
- [ ] Server configuration review

## Reporting & Remediation

### Vulnerability Reporting Process
1. Document the vulnerability with clear reproduction steps
2. Classify severity based on CVSS score
3. Report to the security team using the template below
4. Track remediation progress
5. Verify fix implementation

### Vulnerability Report Template
```
Title: [Brief description of vulnerability]
CVSS Score: [Score]
Affected Component: [Component name]
Description: [Detailed description]
Steps to Reproduce:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
Impact: [Potential impact if exploited]
Recommended Fix: [Suggestion for remediation]
```

### Remediation Priorities
- Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0): Immediate fix required
- High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): Fix within 7 days
- Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): Fix within 30 days
- Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9): Fix within 90 days
