# Your rule content ### **Incorporating These Principles into the Project**

For the **Vibewell** app, these principles can be applied as follows:

1. **KISS and YAGNI**: Keep all features simple and add only those necessary for your current needs. Don't over-engineer.
2. **DRY and SOLID**: Avoid code duplication by using components, functions, and services. Follow SOLID principles to design flexible, easy-to-maintain code.
3. **Security**: Implement strong authentication (e.g., JWT tokens), use environment variables for sensitive data, and protect routes and APIs with role-based access control.
4. **TDD**: Write tests for your features before implementing them, ensuring your app is robust and secure.
5. **CI/CD**: Set up a continuous integration pipeline to automate testing and deployment, ensuring that only secure, well-tested code gets deployed.
6. **Design for Change**: Keep your system flexible, modular, and easy to update, ensuring you can handle future requirements or security patches.

By applying these principles, youâ€™ll ensure that the app is not only high-quality but also secure, scalable, and maintainable in the long run.
