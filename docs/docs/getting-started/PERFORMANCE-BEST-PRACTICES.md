# Performance Best Practices

Optimize your application for speed and responsiveness by following these guidelines:

## 1. Profiling & Monitoring
- Use browser DevTools, Lighthouse, or WebPageTest to measure key metrics (TTFB, FCP, LCP, TTI).
- Establish performance budgets and integrate with CI to prevent regressions.

## 2. Caching Strategies
- **Server-Side**: Use HTTP caching headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Expires`).
- **Client-Side**: Leverage Service Workers, IndexedDB, or localStorage for offline and persistent caching.
- **CDN**: Cache static assets at the CDN edge for faster delivery.

## 3. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Split vendor code and route-based chunks using dynamic `import()`.
- Lazy-load non-critical components and assets to reduce initial bundle size.
- Use React `Suspense` for loading fallbacks.

## 4. Asset Optimization
- Compress images (WebP/AVIF) and use responsive `srcset` for varying viewport sizes.
- Minify and tree-shake JavaScript and CSS.
- Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content and defer the rest.

## 5. Network Optimizations
- Preload key assets (`<link rel="preload">` for fonts and scripts).
- Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 to multiplex requests.
- Minimize third-party scripts and measure their impact.

## 6. Resource Prioritization
- Use `rel=preconnect` for critical origins (e.g., analytics, API endpoints).
- Defer non-essential scripts using `async` or `defer` attributes.

## 7. Server-Side Rendering & Caching
- Use SSR or SSG (Static Site Generation) for faster first paint.
- Implement incremental static regeneration or on-demand revalidation when appropriate.

## 8. Performance in Production
- Monitor real user metrics (RUM) for front-end and back-end latency.
- Set up alerts for performance regressions.
- Continuously iterate based on data, not assumptions.
