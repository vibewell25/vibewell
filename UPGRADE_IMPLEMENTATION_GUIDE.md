# Vibewell Dependency Upgrade Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to use the dependency upgrade script and provides strategies for managing risks during the upgrade process. The upgrade addresses all 69 outdated packages identified in the dependency report.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the upgrade process, ensure you have:

1. Backed up your project or working on a dedicated branch
2. Committed all current changes to Git
3. Have a clean working directory
4. Sufficient disk space for package installations
5. Access to run all tests

## Upgrade Approach

The upgrade is divided into 5 phases + final validation:

1. **Critical Framework Updates**: Next.js, React, Express
2. **Replace Deprecated Packages**: Types, Babel plugins, utilities
3. **Library Updates**: Three.js, UI frameworks, data management
4. **TypeScript and Build Tools**: TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, Prisma
5. **Miscellaneous Updates**: Auth, monitoring, utilities

Each phase is isolated in its own Git branch for easier troubleshooting and rollback if needed.

## Running the Upgrade Script

The script can run all phases or individual phases:

```bash
# Run all phases
./execute-upgrade-plan.sh

# Run a specific phase (1-5)
./execute-upgrade-plan.sh 1

# Run only final validation
./execute-upgrade-plan.sh final
```

## What Each Phase Updates

### Phase 1: Critical Framework Updates
- Next.js ecosystem (next, @next/bundle-analyzer, eslint-config-next)
- React ecosystem (react, react-dom, types)
- Express (server)
- Expo and React Navigation (mobile)

### Phase 2: Replace Deprecated Packages
- @types/* packages with built-in types
- Outdated Babel plugins
- JWT packages
- Helmet
- Glob and rimraf utilities

### Phase 3: Library Updates
- Three.js ecosystem
- UI component libraries (Chakra UI, MUI, Framer Motion)
- State management (Zustand, Redux Toolkit)
- Expo SDK libraries for mobile

### Phase 4: TypeScript and Build Tools
- TypeScript across all workspaces
- ESLint and Prettier
- Jest and Vitest
- Prisma ORM

### Phase 5: Miscellaneous Updates
- Auth0 integration
- Sentry monitoring
- Various utilities (date-fns, web-vitals, etc.)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Before Each Phase

1. **Review Dependencies**: Review the dependency relationships for the packages being updated
2. **Check Breaking Changes**: Review changelogs of major version bumps for breaking changes
3. **Backup**: Ensure you have a clean Git state to revert if needed

### During Each Phase

1. **Package Backup**: The script backs up package.json before each update
2. **Script Disabling**: Temporarily disables post-install scripts to avoid patch-package issues
3. **Incremental Updates**: Updates packages in logical groups to isolate issues
4. **Test Verification**: Runs smoke tests after each phase

### After Each Phase

1. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing of critical app functionality
2. **Fix Issues**: Address any compatibility issues before proceeding
3. **Commit Changes**: Commit successful changes before moving to the next phase

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Peer Dependency Conflicts

If you encounter peer dependency warnings or errors:

```
npm ERR! Conflicting peer dependency: react@18.2.0
```

**Solution**: Install the specific peer dependency version:

```bash
npm install react@18.2.0 --save-exact
```

### Breaking Changes in APIs

If a component or API no longer works due to breaking changes:

1. Check the package's migration guide
2. Update the code to use the new API
3. Add adapter/compatibility layer if needed

### Build or Type Errors

If you encounter build failures or TypeScript errors:

1. Check for type definition updates
2. Update imports to match new module paths
3. Fix type errors according to new type definitions

## Rollback Procedures

### Rolling Back a Phase

If a phase causes issues that cannot be easily fixed:

1. Discard changes and return to previous state:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Selectively rollback specific packages:
   ```bash
   npm install package-name@previous-version --save-exact
   ```

### Emergency Rollback

In case of critical failures:

1. Restore from backup branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout backup-branch
   ```

2. Restore package-lock.json and node_modules:
   ```bash
   git checkout backup-branch -- package-lock.json
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm ci
   ```

## Post-Upgrade Steps

After successfully completing all phases:

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run the full test suite
2. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation referencing updated packages
3. **Check for Deprecated Warnings**: Address any remaining deprecation warnings
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify that the app performance is maintained or improved
5. **Security Scanning**: Run security checks on the updated dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Script Failures

If the script fails during execution:

1. Check the error message for details
2. Fix the underlying issue
3. Resume from the failed phase
4. If necessary, manually complete the failed operation

### Test Failures

If tests fail after an update:

1. Identify the failing tests and related packages
2. Check for breaking changes in the updated packages
3. Update test code to accommodate API changes
4. If necessary, revert specific package updates

### Build System Issues

If you encounter build configuration issues:

1. Check for changes in build tool APIs
2. Update webpack/babel/tsconfig configurations
3. Check for compatibility between build tools and frameworks

## Performance Monitoring

Before and after the upgrade, monitor:

1. Bundle sizes
2. Load times
3. Memory usage
4. API response times

Use the built-in performance monitoring scripts:

```bash
npm run monitor:performance
```
