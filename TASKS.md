- Integrate with Supabase storage for avatar uploads

#### USR-02: Implement Role-Based Access Control [COMPLETED]
**Description:** Complete the role-based access control system to properly restrict access to features based on user roles.

**Requirements:**
- Implement role-based route protection middleware
- Create admin, provider, and customer role permissions
- Add role assignment functionality for admins
- Implement UI adaptation based on user role
- Create role verification utilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unauthorized access attempts redirect to appropriate pages
- Admin-only routes are protected from regular users
- UI components adapt based on user permissions
- Role changes take effect immediately without requiring re-login
- Clear error messages for insufficient permissions

**Notes:**
- Build on existing auth utilities in `src/lib/auth`
- Coordinate with backend team for role persistence

## Phase 2: Business & Provider Features

### Provider Features

#### PRV-01: Business Profile Creation
**Description:** Implement the business profile creation functionality for service providers, allowing them to showcase their services and expertise.

**Requirements:**
- Create multi-step business profile setup wizard
- Implement business information form with validation
- Add service category selection
- Create business hours configuration interface
- Implement location and service area settings
- Add business verification system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Providers can complete profile setup through intuitive wizard
- All business information is validated and stored correctly
- Business profiles display correctly on public pages
- Business hours reflect time zones and special dates
- Location information integrates with maps API

**Notes:**
- Use the wizard component from `src/components/wizard`
- Coordinate with design team for business profile templates

### Analytics Dashboard

#### ANA-01: Data Visualization for Analytics [COMPLETED]
**Description:** Implement visual representations of analytics data including charts, graphs, and trend indicators for the admin dashboard.

**Requirements:**
- Create reusable chart components for key metrics
- Implement real-time data visualization using WebSockets
- Add filtering and time period selection
- Create comparison views (month-over-month, year-over-year)
- Implement drill-down functionality for detailed analysis

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All charts render correctly with proper labels and legends
- Data updates in real-time without page refreshes
