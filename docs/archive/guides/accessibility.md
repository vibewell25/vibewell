# VibeWell Accessibility Implementation

This directory contains components, fixes, and scripts to improve the accessibility of the VibeWell platform according to the recommendations in the accessibility audit.

## Components

- **SkipLink**: A component that allows keyboard users to skip navigation and go directly to main content
- **ScreenReaderText**: Utility component for text that's only visible to screen readers
- **LiveAnnouncer**: Component for making dynamic changes known to screen reader users
- **AccessibleDialog**: A dialog component with proper focus management
- **FormErrorMessage**: Component that associates error messages with form fields
- **AccessibleIcon**: Icon wrapper that ensures proper screen reader support

## Fixes

- **focus-styles.css**: Enhanced focus styles for keyboard navigation
- **fix-color-contrast.js**: Script to update Tailwind colors for better contrast

1. Run the implementation script:
   ```

   ```

2. Test the application using:
   - Keyboard-only navigation
