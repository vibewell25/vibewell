# Migration Guides

This directory contains documentation to help standardize code and migrate from older implementations to the standardized ones.

## Available Guides

- [Auth Hook Migration Guide](auth-migration-guide.md) - Migrate to the standardized authentication hook
- [Form Validation Migration Guide](form-validation-migration-guide.md) - Migrate to the centralized form validation utility

## Purpose

These guides help developers:

1. Understand why standardization is important
2. Learn how to replace deprecated implementations with standardized ones
3. Update their code to conform to project best practices
4. Troubleshoot common issues during migration

## Using These Guides

Each guide follows a standard format:

1. **Overview** - Brief explanation of what's being standardized
2. **Why** - Reasons for the standardization
3. **Migration Steps** - Step-by-step instructions
4. **Examples** - Before and after code examples
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Contributing

When creating new migration guides:

1. Follow the same structure as existing guides
2. Include code examples that show both old and new implementations
3. Provide clear steps for developers to follow
4. Include automation scripts when possible
5. Update the main README.md to link to the new guide
