## Current Focus
Our current focus has shifted to implementing the comprehensive plans we've created for the remaining medium and long-term tasks. With the recent completion of security monitoring, magic link authentication, production logging, and event-related features, we're now prioritizing performance optimization and continuing to increase test coverage. The next steps involve executing our implementation plans according to the defined timelines and priorities.
