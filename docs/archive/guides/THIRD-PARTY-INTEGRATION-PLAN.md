## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Planning and Architecture (Week 1 for each integration)
- [ ] Document requirements and use cases
- [ ] Research API capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Design integration architecture
- [ ] Define security and privacy considerations
- [ ] Create API key management strategy

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 2-3 for each integration)
- [ ] Implement server-side integration components
- [ ] Create client-side integration components
- [ ] Develop error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create configuration management

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Week 4 for each integration)
- [ ] Develop integration tests
- [ ] Perform security testing
- [ ] Validate functionality across environments
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Documentation and knowledge sharing

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- All API keys stored in environment variables
- Implementation of proper authentication flows

- Comprehensive logging
- Dependency management strategy
- Version pinning for stability

### Reliability
- Implementing circuit breakers for API calls
- Fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Retry strategies for transient failures
- Alerting for service disruptions
