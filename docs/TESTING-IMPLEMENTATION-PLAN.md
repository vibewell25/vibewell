# Testing Implementation Plan

This document outlines our progress in enhancing the testing infrastructure for the Vibewell project and provides a plan for next steps.

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks

1. **TypeScript declaration files**:
   - Created `src/types/jest-dom.d.ts` for DOM testing utilities
   - Created `src/types/jest-axe.d.ts` for accessibility testing
   - Created `src/types/user-event.d.ts` for user event simulation

2. **Mock files**:
   - Created `__mocks__/three.js` for mocking Three.js library
   - Created `__mocks__/GLTFLoader.js` for GLTFLoader
   - Created `__mocks__/DRACOLoader.js` for DRACOLoader
   - Created `__mocks__/fileMock.js` for file imports
   - Created `__mocks__/styleMock.js` for style imports

3. **Jest configuration**:
   - Created `jest.enhanced-setup.js` with enhanced setup for testing
   - Created `jest.enhanced.config.js` with comprehensive Jest configuration

4. **API testing utilities**:
   - Created `src/test-utils/server.ts` with MSW setup for API mocking
   - Added example health service test in `src/services/health.test.ts`

5. **Testing utilities**:
   - Created `src/test-utils/testing-utils.ts` with common testing functions

6. **Documentation**:
   - Created `TESTING-README.md` with comprehensive documentation
   - Created implementation plans and strategies

7. **Example tests**:
   - Created `Button.test.tsx` for unit testing
   - Created `AccessibleButton.test.tsx` for accessibility testing
   - Created `Form.test.tsx` for integration testing
   - Created `Card.test.tsx` for component testing

8. **Setup scripts**:
   - Created `scripts/install-test-dependencies.sh` for installing dependencies
   - Created `scripts/test-infrastructure.sh` for verifying infrastructure

9. **Package.json updates**:
   - Added new test scripts for enhanced testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Run the infrastructure verification script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh
   ```

2. **Install missing dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:setup
   ```

3. **Run tests with enhanced configuration**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:enhanced
   ```

### Short-term Tasks (1-2 weeks)

1. **Fix existing test files**:
   - Update existing tests to use the new testing utilities
   - Fix type errors in test files
   - Update expectations to use proper Jest matchers

2. **Add tests for critical components**:
   - Add tests for main layout components
   - Add tests for form components and validation logic
   - Add tests for API services

3. **Set up test coverage reporting**:
   - Configure Jest to generate coverage reports
   - Set up CI/CD to track coverage changes

### Medium-term Tasks (1-2 months)

1. **Implement integration tests for key workflows**:
   - User authentication flow
   - Booking flow
   - Profile management
   - Payment processing

2. **Implement E2E tests**:
   - Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing
   - Create tests for critical user journeys

3. **Optimize test performance**:
   - Implement test sharding for parallel execution
   - Optimize mock implementations for better performance

### Long-term Tasks (3-6 months)

1. **Achieve 80% test coverage for critical code paths**:
   - Increase test coverage for UI components to 80%
   - Achieve 90% coverage for critical business logic

2. **Implement visual regression testing**:
   - Set up tools for visual regression testing
   - Create baseline screenshots for key UI components

3. **Implement performance testing**:
   - Set up performance testing for critical API endpoints
   - Create performance benchmarks for UI rendering

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Testing Priority**:
   - Focus first on critical business functionality
   - Prioritize code with high complexity or risk

2. **Test Types**:
   - Unit tests: For individual components and functions
   - Integration tests: For component interactions
   - API tests: For backend services
   - End-to-end tests: For critical user flows

3. **Test Standards**:
   - All tests should be clear and focused on specific functionality
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
   - Follow the pattern: "it should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
   - Keep test files alongside the code they're testing

4. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Run all tests on every PR and merge to main
   - Set up coverage thresholds to prevent regressions

## Conclusion

By implementing this testing strategy, we will significantly enhance the quality and reliability of the Vibewell application. This structured approach will help us identify issues early, reduce bugs in production, and build confidence in our codebase.
