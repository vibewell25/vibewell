# Module Boundaries

When designing well-defined modules and services, adhere to these principles to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability:

## 1. Align with Business Domains
- Group code by business capabilities (e.g., `booking/`, `user/`, `payments/`).
- Each domain owns its data, logic, and APIs (Domain-Driven Design).

## 2. Single Responsibility & Cohesion
- Modules should have one reason to change. Keep functionality focused.
- Avoid mixing unrelated concerns in the same module (e.g., validation logic in UI components).

## 3. Loose Coupling & Clear Interfaces
- Expose only public APIs via well-defined interfaces or service contracts.
- Depend on abstractions, not implementations (Dependency Inversion Principle).
- Use events or messaging (Pub/Sub) for decoupled service communication when appropriate.

## 4. Layered Architecture
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles requests/responses (UI, API controllers).
- **Application Layer**: Coordinates use cases and application workflows.
- **Domain Layer**: Encapsulates business entities, rules, and invariants.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Deals with persistence, external APIs, and third-party services.

## 5. Data Ownership and Boundaries
- Each module or microservice should own and manage its own data store.
- Use API calls or domain events to share data across boundariesâ€”never access another module's database directly.

## 6. Versioning for Backward Compatibility
- Version your public-facing APIs to support safe evolution (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
- Maintain compatibility for existing consumers when introducing breaking changes.

## 7. Deployment & Packaging
- Package modules or services independently for deployment (monorepo packages, Docker images).
- Automate builds and deployments per service to avoid cross-team dependencies.

## 8. Observability Across Boundaries
- Instrument logging, metrics, and distributed tracing to trace requests across modules.
- Tag logs and metrics with correlation IDs to visualize end-to-end flows.
