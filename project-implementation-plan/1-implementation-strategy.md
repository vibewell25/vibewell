# Vibewell Platform Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation strategy to align the Vibewell platform with the required systems and versions, focusing on both web and mobile platforms.

## Phase 1: System Updates and Standardization

### 1.1 Frontend (Web) Updates
- [x] Fix Performance Monitoring Integration
- [ ] Update TypeScript to v5.3.3+
- [ ] Implement TailwindCSS properly 
- [ ] Standardize UI component library
- [ ] Update Next.js configuration

### 1.2 Mobile App Setup
- [ ] Create React Native v0.72+ project
- [ ] Setup mobile app structure
- [ ] Implement shared code mechanism
- [ ] Configure mobile performance monitoring

### 1.3 Backend Standardization
- [ ] Set up Express.js server (Node.js v18 LTS)
- [ ] Refactor API from Next.js API routes to Express
- [ ] Standardize PostgreSQL integration with Prisma
- [ ] Implement Redis for caching/queue

### 1.4 Authentication System
- [ ] Implement JWT-based auth with Passport.js
- [ ] Create standard auth flows for web and mobile
- [ ] Set up proper role-based access control

## Phase 2: DevOps & Infrastructure

### 2.1 Containerization
- [ ] Create proper Docker setup with Docker 24.x
- [ ] Implement docker-compose for local development
- [ ] Configure production Dockerfile with optimizations

### 2.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Configure testing, build, and deployment steps
- [ ] Implement automated versioning

### 2.3 Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Setup Prometheus 2.44
- [ ] Configure Grafana 9.x
- [ ] Implement centralized logging
- [ ] Connect performance monitoring to analytics

## Phase 3: Codebase Organization & Structure

### 3.1 Monorepo Setup
- [ ] Create monorepo structure (/web, /mobile, /shared)
- [ ] Set up workspace management
- [ ] Configure shared dependencies
- [ ] Implement cross-platform build scripts

### 3.2 Code Structure Standardization
- [ ] Implement consistent folder structure
- [ ] Standardize import patterns
- [ ] Create common utilities and hooks
- [ ] Implement shared types system

### 3.3 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Jest for unit testing
- [ ] Configure Cypress for integration tests
- [ ] Create test utilities and mocks
- [ ] Implement shared test helpers
