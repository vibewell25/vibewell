# Security Features Guide

## Overview
This guide provides detailed information about Vibewell's security features and how to use them effectively.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### What is 2FA?
Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring two different forms of verification:
1. Your password
2. A time-based one-time password (TOTP) from an authenticator app

### Setting Up 2FA

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Install an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
   - Ensure you're signed in to your Vibewell account

2. **Enable 2FA**
   - Go to Security Settings
   - Click "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
   - Enter your password to confirm

3. **Configuration Steps**
   - Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
   - Enter the 6-digit verification code
   - Save your backup codes in a secure location

4. **Backup Codes**
   - You'll receive 8 one-time use backup codes
   - Store these securely offline
   - Use them if you lose access to your authenticator app
   - Generate new backup codes after using any

### Using 2FA

1. **Regular Login**
   - Enter your email and password
   - When prompted, open your authenticator app
   - Enter the 6-digit code
   - Select "Remember this device" (optional)

2. **Using Backup Codes**
   - Click "Use backup code" on the 2FA screen
   - Enter one of your backup codes
   - The code becomes invalid after use
   - Generate new backup codes when running low

3. **Managing Devices**
   - View currently trusted devices
   - Remove devices you no longer use
   - Set device trust expiration

### Troubleshooting 2FA

1. **Lost Access to Authenticator**
   - Use a backup code to sign in
   - Disable 2FA if necessary
   - Re-enable with a new device

2. **Invalid Codes**
   - Ensure your device's time is correct
   - Check if the code has expired
   - Try the next generated code
