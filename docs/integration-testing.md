# Integration Testing Guide

This guide covers integration testing for the Vibewell application, with a particular focus on backup and recovery functionality. Integration tests validate that different components of the system work together as expected.

## Overview

Integration tests verify the interactions between different parts of the application, ensuring that data flows correctly between services and components. Unlike unit tests that test components in isolation, integration tests examine how components behave together.

### Test Focus Areas

Our integration tests focus on several critical systems:

- **Backup and Recovery System**: Testing the complete backup creation, verification, and restoration process
- **Authentication Flow**: Testing the interaction between authentication services and user management
- **Payment Processing**: Testing the integration with payment gateways and order management
- **Notification System**: Testing the delivery of notifications across different channels
- **External API Integrations**: Testing connections to third-party services

## Backup and Recovery Testing

The backup and recovery system is critical for data resilience and business continuity. Our integration tests verify:

### Backup Process
- **Backup Creation**: Testing the creation of full and incremental backups
- **Data Integrity**: Verifying that backups contain all required data
- **Encryption**: Testing that sensitive data is properly encrypted
- **Compression**: Verifying efficient storage through compression
- **Storage Integration**: Testing uploads to local storage and cloud providers

### Recovery Process
- **Backup Verification**: Testing the integrity validation of backups before restoration
- **Data Restoration**: Verifying complete and accurate restoration of backed-up data
- **Error Handling**: Testing recovery from corrupted or incomplete backups
- **Performance**: Measuring restoration times under different data loads
- **Post-Recovery Validation**: Verifying system integrity after recovery

## Implementation

Integration tests use:

- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion framework
- **Mocks**: For simulating external dependencies
- **Test Database**: Isolated database for testing
- **Supabase Testing**: Mocked Supabase client for testing database interactions

### Test Structure

A typical integration test follows this structure:

1. **Setup**: Initialize test environment and dependencies
2. **Execute**: Run the integrated components
3. **Verify**: Check that the expected interactions occur
4. **Cleanup**: Reset the test environment

## Running Integration Tests

Integration tests can be run using:

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npx jest tests/integration

# Run specific integration tests
npx jest tests/integration/backup-recovery.test.ts

# Run as part of the complete test suite
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Writing New Integration Tests

When writing new integration tests:

1. **Identify Integration Points**: Focus on interfaces between components
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Simulate third-party services
3. **Set Up Test Data**: Use fixtures or factories to create consistent test data
4. **Test Error Scenarios**: Verify behavior when integrations fail
5. **Clean Up Test Data**: Ensure tests don't affect subsequent test runs

### Example Test

Here's a simplified example of a backup and recovery integration test:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from '@jest/globals';
import { BackupService } from '@/lib/backup/backup-service';

describe('Backup and Recovery Integration', () => {
  let backupService;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set up test environment and mock dependencies
  });
  
  it('should create and restore a backup successfully', async () => {
    // Create backup
    const backupResult = await backupService.createBackup();
    expect(backupResult.success).toBe(true);
    
    // Verify backup
    const isValid = await backupService.verifyBackup(backupResult.backupId);
    expect(isValid).toBe(true);
    
    // Restore backup
    await backupService.restoreBackup(backupResult.backupId);
    
    // Verify restoration
    // Check that data was properly restored
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent
- **Use Test Databases**: Don't test against production databases
- **Mock External Services**: Avoid dependencies on external systems
- **Test Realistic Scenarios**: Focus on real-world integration patterns
- **Monitor Test Performance**: Integration tests should be reasonably fast

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with integration tests:

- **Test Interdependence**: Tests that depend on the state from other tests
  - Solution: Reset state between tests and use unique identifiers

- **External Service Dependencies**: Tests that fail due to external service availability
  - Solution: Use consistent mocks and fallbacks

- **Slow Tests**: Tests that take too long due to integration complexity
  - Solution: Focus on critical paths and use selective mocking
