# Test Infrastructure and Improvements Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Fixed Failing Tests and Testing Infrastructure
- Created TypeScript declarations for testing libraries (`jest-dom.d.ts`, `jest-axe.d.ts`, `user-event.d.ts`)
- Created mocks for problematic dependencies:
  - Three.js and related loaders (GLTFLoader, DRACOLoader, etc.)
  - MSW for API mocking in tests
  - Implemented proper userEvent mocks for UI interaction testing
- Updated Jest configuration files to ensure proper setup and transformation rules
- Enhanced Jest setup file with proper mocks and utilities

### 2. Implemented Security Scanning
- Created `setup-security-scanning.sh` script to set up automated security scanning
- Added security scanning scripts to package.json
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for automated security scanning
- Created security middleware for API routes
- Added security headers configuration for Next.js
- Created comprehensive security scanning documentation

### 3. Improved Test Runner
- Enhanced the test-runner.js with better error handling and compatibility
- Fixed user interaction helpers for more reliable testing
- Improved accessibility testing utilities

## Work In Progress

### 1. Fixing Remaining Test Failures
- Some tests still fail due to component-specific issues
- Need to update test expectations to match current component behavior
- Some timing issues in async tests need to be resolved

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Continue Increasing Test Coverage
- Focus on critical components next:
  - Navigation
  - Authentication flows
  - User profile components
  - Main data entry forms
- Aim for 50% test coverage of core components in next phase

### 2. Implement Performance Monitoring
- Set up real user monitoring (RUM)
- Establish performance budgets
- Create CI/CD integration for performance testing
- Implement automated performance regression detection

### 3. Begin Component Standardization
- Audit existing components
- Create standardized component library
- Implement consistent API patterns
- Document component usage patterns

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Run the security scanning setup script to implement security automation
2. Fix the remaining test failures in failed test cases
3. Start increasing test coverage of critical components
4. Implement initial performance monitoring
5. Begin component standardization efforts

## Metrics and Goals

- **Current Test Coverage**: ~4.24% (28 test files out of 661 source files)
- **Target Test Coverage**: 30% within 1 month, 50% within 3 months
- **Security Compliance**: Aim for zero high or critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance Budget**: Core components should render in under 50ms
