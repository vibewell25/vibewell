# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status

- **Current Coverage**: 4.24% (28 test files / 661 source files)
- **Target Coverage**: 50% for core components within 2 months
- **Priority Areas**: Auth functionality, form validation, API endpoints

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Value-based testing**: Focus on testing high-value, business-critical components first
2. **Risk-based prioritization**: Prioritize components with high risk or complexity
3. **Progressive coverage**: Start with critical paths and expand outward
4. **Test types balance**: Maintain a balance of unit, integration, and e2e tests

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-2)

| Area | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Auth | 0% | 60% | HIGH |
| Form Validation | 15% | 70% | HIGH |
| API Endpoints | 0% | 40% | HIGH |

#### Tasks:

1. **Auth Testing**
   - Write tests for auth hooks
   - Test user authentication flows
   - Validate role-based access control
   - Test token handling and refresh

2. **Form Validation Testing**
   - Expand existing validation tests
   - Test all validation rules
   - Test error handling
   - Test complex form scenarios

3. **API Endpoint Testing**
   - Setup API testing infrastructure
   - Test critical endpoints first
   - Validate response formats
   - Test error handling

### Phase 2: Business Logic (Weeks 3-4)

| Area | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Booking System | 0% | 50% | MEDIUM |
| User Management | 5% | 40% | MEDIUM |
| Payment Processing | 0% | 60% | HIGH |

#### Tasks:

1. **Booking System Testing**
   - Test appointment creation
   - Test scheduling conflicts
   - Test cancellation flows
   - Test notifications

2. **User Management Testing**
   - Test user registration
   - Test profile updates
   - Test role management
   - Test user preferences

3. **Payment Processing Testing**
   - Test payment methods
   - Test successful payment flows
   - Test failure scenarios
   - Test refund processes

### Phase 3: UI Components (Weeks 5-6)

| Area | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Base Components | 0% | 70% | MEDIUM |
| Form Components | 10% | 60% | MEDIUM |
| Layout Components | 0% | 40% | LOW |

#### Tasks:

1. **Base Component Testing**
   - Test all props and variants
   - Test accessibility
   - Test responsive behavior
   - Test user interactions

2. **Form Component Testing**
   - Test input components
   - Test form submission
   - Test error states
   - Test complex form interactions

3. **Layout Component Testing**
   - Test responsive layouts
   - Test navigation components
   - Test modals and overlays
   - Test dynamic content containers

### Phase 4: Integration & E2E (Weeks 7-8)

| Area | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| User Flows | 0% | 30% | HIGH |
| System Integration | 0% | 20% | MEDIUM |
| External Services | 0% | 30% | MEDIUM |

#### Tasks:

1. **User Flow Testing**
   - Test critical user journeys
   - Test cross-component interactions
   - Test state persistence
   - Test error recovery

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test component composition
   - Test service integration
   - Test data flow between components
   - Test system boundaries

3. **External Service Testing**
   - Test third-party integrations
   - Test API dependencies
   - Test backup mechanisms
   - Test failure handling

## Implementation Approach

### Test Structure

All tests will follow a standardized structure:

```typescript
// File: src/components/MyComponent.test.tsx

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  // Setup - run before each test
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Common setup goes here
  });

  // Test cases grouped by functionality
  describe('rendering', () => {
    it('renders correctly with default props', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('renders in different states', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });

  describe('interactions', () => {
    it('handles user interactions correctly', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('responds to events properly', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });

  describe('accessibility', () => {
    it('meets accessibility requirements', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Test runner and assertions
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **MSW**: API mocking
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing
- **Storybook**: Component documentation and visual testing

### Automation and CI/CD

- Automated test runs on every PR
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Block merges if coverage decreases significantly
- Daily scheduled full test runs

## Measuring Progress

We will track progress using the following metrics:

1. **Coverage Percentage**: Line and branch coverage
2. **Test Count**: Number of tests by component
3. **Critical Path Coverage**: Coverage of business-critical paths
4. **Defect Detection**: Number of defects caught by tests

### Example Progress Dashboard:

```
Weekly Coverage Report: Week 3
-----------------------------
Overall Coverage: 18.2% (+5.6%)
Critical Path Coverage: 32.5% (+12.1%)
New Tests Added: 47
Defects Caught: 8
```

## Getting Started

To begin improving test coverage:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
```

2. Run existing tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

3. Generate a coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

4. Identify components without tests:
```bash
npm run test:find-untested
```
